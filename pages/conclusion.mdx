# Conclusion

The conversation between these speakers offers a profound and insightful perspective on the nature of reality, consciousness, and our place within the grand metaphysical "construct" governing existence. While their ideas may seem abstract and unconventional, there are several key takeaways that could fundamentally shift our understanding of the world around us.

Firstly, the concept of perceiving humans as mere instances or objects within a larger "program" or "system" challenges our conventional notions of reality and identity. Just as a computer program executes code to instantiate objects with specific properties and behaviors, our existence could be viewed as emerging from a similar underlying metaphysical source code or construct.

To truly grasp this perspective requires transcending the limited lens of ordinary human consciousness and the ego construct that binds us to narrow self-identities and subjective experiences. As the speakers emphasize, achieving "ego dissolution" and setting the "observer property" to true allows for a more detached, universal vantage point from which to perceive the true nature of reality.

This state of expanded awareness, often facilitated by psychedelics and plant medicines, is what distinguishes the "dot psychonauts" from those still trapped within the confines of the human construct. [The Observer Property](/transcending-the-ego/the-observer-property) seems to be a key attribute that unlocks the ability to observe the reality "program" as an external witness, rather than being fully immersed and identified with its contents.

However, the speakers also caution against getting lost in complexity and convoluted philosophies. Instead, they advocate for [Finding Resources in Simplicity](/resources-in-simplicity) – stripping away layers of complexity to arrive at the simple, distilled essence of existence. This aligns with their use of coding analogies and programming concepts to articulate their perspective, as these inherently rely on simplicity, logic, and elegant problem-solving.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Achieve ego dissolution and set the observer property to true through practices like meditation or psychedelic exploration.

### Step 2 
Embrace simplicity and use coding/programming analogies to conceptualize reality as an information system or construct, rather than getting mired in complex philosophies.

### Step 3
Adopt a detached, universal perspective to observe the reality "program" and our existence as mere instances within it, without being fully identified with the ego and subjective human experience.

Ultimately, the implications of this perspective are vast and thought-provoking. It challenges us to question the very foundations of our perceived reality and to explore the boundaries of human consciousness. While the speakers acknowledge the inherent limitations in fully comprehending or "hacking" the metaphysical construct, their ideas open up new avenues for inquiry and personal growth.

Whether one fully embraces their worldview or not, the conversation serves as a powerful reminder to remain open-minded, to question assumptions, and to continually seek deeper truths about the nature of existence. For as the speakers themselves state, we are all insignificant pieces in a vast, incomprehensible system – and it is only through transcending our ordinary state of consciousness that we may catch glimpses of the greater reality that encompasses us.
